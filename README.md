This folk aims to extract (last layer) features of pretrained bert models, to support word-embedding functions.  

Two tasks have been raised:  
(1) we are currently using tensorflow 2. some codes of bert need to be updated to support tensorflow 2;  
(2) we want to use this word embedding function (in jupyter notebook) instead of calling a python script outside the notebook.
